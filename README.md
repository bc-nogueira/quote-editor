# Quote Editor

This is a basic project made with Rails 7 to study Turbo Rails.
It's a quote web app where you can create quotes, dates and items.

I coded along during the [Turbo Rails Tutorial](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails) from Hotrails.

## My changes

All commits that come from the course have the chapter identification.
All later commits are changes that I made to the project.
These changes include:

- User registration (TODO)

## Check it in action

_TODO: Finish instructions._

To run this project on your local machine you need to have Postgres and Redis.
Then, you can run it with:

1. Clone this repository and access the its directory.
2. Run `bundle` to install the gems.
3. Run `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed`.
4. Then run `bin/dev`.
